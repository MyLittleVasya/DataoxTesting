 <p><strong>What does the Data team look like?</strong></p> 
 <p>At Bench, the Data team encompasses the full gamut of business intelligence and data analytics activities. We are responsible for creating and maintaining the infrastructure that gets analysts and leadership across the company the information they need. We do this by developing and maintaining data pipelines, a data warehouse, and visualization tools, and by leading the adoption of new technology and practices to improve the lives of our data consumers. We also ensure that our data infrastructure is fit-for-purpose by using it ourselves as analysts for our Product team, and by filling any gaps in reporting and analysis that aren’t covered by analysts elsewhere in the company.</p> 
 <p><strong>What you’ll get up to:</strong></p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Listen to requests from analysts or business partners, deeply understand their needs, and translate those needs into requirements for data products</li> 
  <li>Write analytic queries that transform raw data from source systems into business facts and metrics</li> 
  <li>Review queries, scripts, and visualizations produced by other analysts to ensure consistent accuracy and quality</li> 
  <li>Apply software engineering best practices like version control and continuous integration to the analytics code base.</li> 
  <li>Produce presentations, dashboards, and self-service tools to make data accessible to and understandable by everyone at Bench</li> 
  <li>Participate in planning and prioritization of work to be done by the Data team</li> 
  <li>Protect our clients and colleagues by maintaining security and access control over our data</li> 
  <li>Learn about emerging or established data technologies and evaluate whether Bench can benefit from their adoption</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p><strong>Must haves:</strong><em> </em></p> 
 <ul> 
  <li> <strong>SQL expertise</strong>: Writing, debugging, and reviewing queries that make heavy use of analytics functionality (complex aggregations, window functions, common table expressions) and that operate on many rows of data is a daily occurrence in this role.</li> 
  <li> <strong>Data visualization and storytelling:</strong> We create value when the things we build are being used. For us, that means translating data into useful insights using a BI tool (eg. Tableau, Power BI), or even an effective graph or dashboard in Excel/Google Sheets.</li> 
  <li> <strong>Cloud Services: </strong>Experience with cloud services used in data analytics, ideally AWS (eg. Redshift, Glue, DMS, Lambda), will enable you to operate at every stage of our data pipeline.</li> 
  <li> <strong>Proficiency with version control systems</strong>: We source-control our analytics code to ensure that metrics are consistent, no matter who pulls the data. Experience using the feature branch Git workflow model will help you understand how logic gets “promoted to production”.</li> 
  <li> <strong>Technical written and verbal communication</strong>: From going deep on technical details with fellow analysts, to explaining results to business partners, to forming recommendations for senior leadership, you possess effective written and verbal communication skills at a wide range of complexity and detail.</li> 
  <li> <strong>Responsibility and leadership:</strong> Our success depends on taking ownership and building trust - both among teammates and with stakeholders. To maintain that trust, we expect each other to make commitments, to keep those commitments, and to hold ourselves to account for those commitments.</li> 
  <li> <strong>Curiosity, mentorship and a drive to learn: </strong>We become better analysts and technologists through continuous learning and by teaching others what we know. Fostering growth is what we do here, in ourselves and in our colleagues. You are as committed to your own growth as that of your team.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p><strong>Nice to haves:</strong></p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Exposure to workflow orchestration tools (eg. Airflow, Prefect, Luigi)</li> 
  <li>Experience with dbt Core / Cloud</li> 
  <li>Familiarity with Agile/Scrum methodologies</li> 
  <li>Previous experience in SaaS growth, product, or marketing analytics</li>

  <p><strong>Context:</strong></p> 
  <p>Developing renewable energy requires the ability to store its production and develop ways to stabilize the electrical grid. Stationary storage batteries have become affordable and they address these problems, but their operation is not so simple.</p> 
  <p>A battery has access to many sources of revenue, each with its own characteristics. Taken separately, no revenue can ensure long-term economic profitability on its own. Taken together, they guarantee stable revenues and rapid battery development.</p> 
  <p>We are developing trading and optimization algorithms to combine battery revenue sources and increase their lifespan. It is like an autopilot that defines in real time the actions that the battery must take on the markets.</p> 
  <p><strong>About us:</strong>StackEase is a deeptech spinoff from INRIA (National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation). The startup was founded in August 2023 and has secured initial funding. Its members are located in Paris and Marseille.</p> 
  <p>Our values are innovation, merit, customer satisfaction, and sustainability. StackEase's raison d'être is to apply advances in machine learning to the energy transition.</p>

  <ul> 
   <li>Develop prediction tools for electricity market prices through supervised learning</li> 
   <li>Develop Reinforcement Learning based trading and optimisation algorithms for grid-scale battery profit optimisation</li> 
   <li>Develop automated unit tests and non regression tests</li> 
   <li>Validate and document results on real case scenarios</li> 
   <li>Participate in real-life test campaign</li> 
   <li>Support the algorithms deployment on the cloud</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Preferred Skills</strong></p> 
  <ul>
