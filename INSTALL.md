# In this file will be instructions for launch of the application
## Requirements:
### To run this application your computer should have installed either JRE(Java Runtime Executable from Java 17) or Docker
## To run it from command line(Windows) through JRE you should:
1. Fetch this repository to any comfortable place on your PC
2. Open command line and navigate to project folder
3. Run `mvn clean install`
4. In project folder navigate to target folder ```cd target```
5. When you there, just write ```java -jar DataOxTesting-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar``` *<--- Name of the -jar can be changed, be careful*
6. After that you will see logs of application launching. If something wrong you\`ll see that either.

## Additional configuration
Application is already ready to use. All the configurations are done, however, it can be changed using env variables before launch.
Configurations that can be changed you can see in resources/application.yml. Mostly its endpoints, url to scrap, database credentials.

### The interaction with the application is preferred through SwaggerUI which is located on `/ui` endpoint.

## SwaggerUI
Application has Swagger UI for comfortable using and debugging. It allows to use main endpoint to scrap data without any additional settings and body creation.  
As said above, the body creation for the request isn\`t needed. The application contains placeholder of body, which as for the 21.01.2024 will display you at least 2 jobs.  
The body can be easily changed, to have less parameters, so that it will find more different jobs.  
The body shouldn\`t contain ```null``` on the paramethers, instead it should be either `[]` or be missing.

### You can view database state through H2 console which is located on `/db` endpoint. Default username is `1` , default password is `1` , database url is `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
### If you want to create csv dump for the database(my own dump is already on git in `data` folder), you should:
1. Open h2 console
2. Login into h2 console
3. In console for command writing enter `CALL CSVWRITE('data/JobTable.csv', 'SELECT * from JOB_TABLE');`
4. Navigate to project folder and it\`s `target` subfolder
5. In target folder will be folder `data` with your csv dump file.
6. If you run application from IDE, than `data` folder will be just in your project folder
